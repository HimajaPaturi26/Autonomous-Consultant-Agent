Autonomous Consultant Agent

An AI system that behaves like a junior management consultant.

It takes messy ideas, half-formed thoughts, or vague goals and turns them into structured thinking, clear problem statements, and actionable strategy.

This is not a chatbot.
This is a thinking system.

The Problem

Most people don’t suffer from lack of ideas.
They suffer from lack of clarity.

Founders, students, and creators often say things like:

“I want to start something but I’m confused.”

“I have an idea but I don’t know where to begin.”

“I feel stuck.”

What they need is not motivation.
They need a thinking partner.

Someone who can

ask the right questions

find the real problem

break chaos into structure

turn fog into a plan

That’s what this agent does.

What This Agent Does

Given any messy input, the agent will:

Ask intelligent clarifying questions

Identify the core problem

Reframe the idea into a clear objective

Break it into sub-problems

Generate a structured strategy

Suggest concrete next actions

It behaves like a junior consultant sitting across the table.

System Design


The agent is built as a multi-stage reasoning pipeline:

User Input
   ↓
Clarifier Module  → asks smart questions
   ↓
Problem Framer    → extracts the real problem
   ↓
Strategist        → builds a plan
   ↓
Action Generator  → outputs next steps


Each stage uses a different prompt persona.

This mimics how real consultants think:
first understand, then frame, then design, then act.

Example Interaction

User:
“I want to do something in AI but I don’t know what.”

Agent:

What attracts you to AI

Do you prefer building, writing, teaching, or consulting

Are you solving a personal problem or a market problem

Then it reframes:

“You are not confused about AI. You are unclear about who you want to become through it.”

And outputs a strategy.

Why This Matters

This project demonstrates:

Prompt architecture

Role-based reasoning

Agent design

Systems thinking

Product mindset

It treats AI as a thinking partner, not a toy.

Roadmap

Add memory across turns

Add multiple agent roles

Add CLI interface

Add web interface

Add evaluation layer
